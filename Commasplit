Here is a Java code snippet that checks if the string `a` contains exactly two values separated by a comma and a space (", "), and if so, splits it into two separate strings:

```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String a = "USA, Ca";
        String[] splitStrings = a.split(", ");
        if (splitStrings.length == 2) {
            String firstString = splitStrings[0];
            String secondString = splitStrings[1];
            System.out.println("First String: " + firstString);
            System.out.println("Second String: " + secondString);
        } else {
            System.out.println("String does not contain exactly two values.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this code:

- We use the `split()` method to split the string `a` into an array of strings using ", " as the delimiter.
- We check if the length of the resulting array is exactly 2.
- If it is, we assign the first and second elements of the array to separate strings (`firstString` and `secondString`) and print them.
- If not, we print a message indicating that the string does not contain exactly two values.

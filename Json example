[21/08, 7:38 pm] Meta AI: Here's an example JSON string with multiple nested documents within a list:

```
{
  "address": [
    {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "Anytown",
      "state": "CA",
      "zip": "12345",
      "country": {
        "name": "USA",
        "code": "US"
      }
    },
    {
      "street": "456 Elm St",
      "city": "Othertown",
      "state": "NY",
      "zip": "67890",
      "country": {
        "name": "USA",
        "code": "US"
      },
      "additionalInfo": {
        "aptNumber": "101",
        "buildingName": "The Building"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This JSON string contains:

- An `address` array with two nested documents
- Each document has `street`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, and `country` properties
- The `country` property is an object with `name` and `code` properties
- The second document has an additional `additionalInfo` object with `aptNumber` and `buildingName` properties

You can use this JSON string to test the Java code I provided earlier. The code should generate an XML string with the following format:

```
<address>
  <street>123 Main St</street>
  <city>Anytown</city>
  <state>CA</state>
  <zip>12345</zip>
  <country>
    <name>USA</name>
    <code>US</code>
  </country>
</address>
<address>
  <street>456 Elm St</street>
  <city>Othertown</city>
  <state>NY</state>
  <zip>67890</zip>
  <country>
    <name>USA</name>
    <code>US</code>
  </country>
  <additionalInfo>
    <aptNumber>101</aptNumber>
    <buildingName>The Building</buildingName>
  </additionalInfo>
</address>
```

Note that the code will recursively traverse the JSON object and generate XML elements for each property, including nested objects and arrays.

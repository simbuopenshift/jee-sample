Here is the complete BigQuery code to achieve this without using a User-Defined Function (UDF):

```
WITH employee AS (
  SELECT
    '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "address": {"street": "123 Main St", "city": "Anytown", "state": "CA", "zip": "12345"}}' AS data
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    '{"name": "Jane", "age": 25, "address": {"street": "456 Elm St", "city": "Othertown", "state": "NY", "zip": "67890"}}'
)

SELECT
  REGEXP_REPLACE(
    REGEXP_REPLACE(
      REGEXP_REPLACE(
        REGEXP_REPLACE(
          JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(data, '$'), 
          r'"([^"]+)"\s*:\s*', '<\\1>' 
        ), 
        r'"{', '<' 
      ), 
      r'"}', '>' 
    ), 
    r',\s*', '' 
  ) AS xml_data
FROM
  employee;
```

This code uses a combination of `REGEXP_REPLACE` functions to transform the JSON data into XML format. The regular expressions used are:

- `r'"([^"]+)"\s*:\s*'` matches key-value pairs in JSON and replaces them with `<key>` format.
- `r'"{'` matches the opening double quote of a JSON value and replaces it with `<`.
- `r'"}'` matches the closing double quote of a JSON value and replaces it with `>`.
- `r',\s*'` matches commas and replaces them with an empty string to remove them from the output.

Note that this code assumes that the JSON data in the `data` column is a simple JSON object. If your JSON data is more complex (e.g., contains arrays or nested objects), you may need to modify the regular expressions accordingly.

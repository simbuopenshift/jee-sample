Certainly! Here's the script for configuring a log-based metric in GCP for a Cloud Run job completed status:

- **Resource Type:** Cloud Run
- **Log Name:** projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity
- **Message:** `"methodName: google.cloud.run.v1.Services.replaceService" AND resource.labels.operation_id: "operations/services/[CLOUD_RUN_JOB_NAME]/"`
  
Replace [PROJECT_ID] with your actual GCP project ID, and [CLOUD_RUN_JOB_NAME] with the name of your Cloud Run job. This configuration will create a log-based metric that triggers whenever a Cloud Run job is completed.
